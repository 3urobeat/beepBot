The owneronly, usermissperm, dmerror and wrongcmd-Errors are now random again an not only changed at a restart because of a bug. *help command will now show the right invite link depending on @beepBot or @beepTestBot send it.

The unmutes or unbans can have an delay of 5 seconds when the bot is running because of the check interval. Many bugs were fixed (from Version 2.7.3 to 2.7.6 - read above) and i am happy to release this update!
