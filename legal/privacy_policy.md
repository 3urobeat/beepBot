### **Why and how data is stored:**
The data listed above is only stored to provide functionality and provide me information about when the bot is added to a server.  
Your data is **not** being analyzed except for when needed to provide functionality (for example a user using the command `rank` to see their level).  
  
All data is stored on my personal, protected Linux server, in a database or log text file.  
The data is only kept for as long as needed. If you remove the bot from your server the data will be deleted after 7 days.  
The server is kept up to date, is password and Cloudflare protected and no one else has physical or remote access to it.  
All data is being backed up every day to an encrypted and 2FA protected online storage to be able to recover from a potential data loss.  

Your data is **not** being shared with any third parties!  

&nbsp;  

### **Data access and removal:**
To access your data, please contact me on the [Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/9Yaj5qSbc8).  
  
To get your data deleted, remove the bot from your server.  
If the bot won't be readded within 7 days then the data will be deleted.
